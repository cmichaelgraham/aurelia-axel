As a Visual Studio TypeScript and C# developer building web-based, spatial information systems targeting a variety of platforms that leverage ESRI and SQL Server, I want a starter kit so that I can rapidly build implementations.  I want the starter kit to include a recipe for creating unit tests, for creating end-to-end (e2e) tests, and for creating reference documentation for both server-side and client-side code assets.

## [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/cmichaelgraham/aurelia-axel/blob/master/quick-start.md#quick-start-guide)
