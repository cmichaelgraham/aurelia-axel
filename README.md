As a Visual Studio TypeScript and C# developer with a Microsoft Windows workstation who is building web-based, spatial information systems targeting a variety of platforms that leverage ESRI and SQL Server, I want a starter kit so that I can rapidly build implementations.  

I want a [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/cmichaelgraham/aurelia-axel/blob/master/quick-start.md#quick-start-guide) that includes recipes for: 
* setting up my environment: 
    * visual studio
    * sql server
    * local copy of aurelia-axel
* creating odata services
* creating client web pages
* creating simple map functions
* creating unit tests
* creating end-to-end (e2e) tests

* creating reference documentation for client-side code assets.
* creating web app client
* creating electron desktop client
